## ieadb scrape

<br>

A simple multi-page web scraping script that parses treaties from the International Environmental Agreements 
(IEA)[ Database Project](https://iea.uoregon.edu/base-agreement-list).
<br>
<br>
A treaty search URL is provided by the user. The script then uses [langdetect](https://github.com/Mimino666/langdetect)
 to find treaties written in English and adds the text to a csv file for later text analysis.

#### What I Learned

This project introduced me to, and allowed me to overcome, some of the challenges involved with web scraping such as 
inconsistencies in webpages, multiple languages, special characters, text encoding, and working with local files.
